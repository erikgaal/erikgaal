## Hi there ü¶Ñ

I'm Erik (he/him), a full stack engineer at [Scrn](https://scrn.com) a small digital agency based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Projects I'm currently working on are almost anything web related to [Eurovision](https://eurovision.tv) and we're launching our first event accreditation platform [Accredion](https://accredion.com) soon.

### üíñ for Open Source

I believe that open source software is essential in tech. That's why I'm actively advocating to contribute to open source in any way possible at the companies and clients I work for. If you have a cool project that you need help with, feel free to reach out.

Here's some projects that I love:
- [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/framework)
- [Laravel Bakery](https://github.com/scrnhq/laravel-bakery) made with ‚ù§Ô∏è by Scrn
- [Livewire](https://github.com/livewire/livewire)
- [Inertia](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia)
- [Homebrew](https://github.com/homebrew/brew)
